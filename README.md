| 81  | [Huongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokoyo, and Bangkok. Each has 5000 users. Active Directory Environment Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012. You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Network Infrastructure Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a dedicated connection to the Internet. Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers. Active Directory Issue Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters. You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD. Licensing Issue You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message: 'Licenses not assigned. License agreement failed for one user.' You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses. Requirements Planned Changes Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will be hosted in Azure. Planned Azure AD Infrastructure The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD. All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain. Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources: Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic. A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2. A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet. A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4 You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings. You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network. Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux. Department Requirements Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments: Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups. During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs from the past week. Authentication Requirements Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

| 144 | [Overview Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner organizations to bring products to market. Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains. Existing Environment Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following: File servers. Domain controllers. Microsoft SQL Server servers Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers are joined to Active Directory. You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers: A SQL database. A web front end. A processing middle tier Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only. Requirements Planned Changes Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure: – Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure. – Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage. – Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project. Technical Requirements Contoso must meet the following technical requirements: Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure. Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers. Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups. Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet. Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier. Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary. Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure. Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines. Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile phone to verify their identity. Minimize administrative effort whenever possible. User Requirements Contoso identifies the following requirements for users: Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD. Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service administrator of the Azure subscription. Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages. Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription. You need to implement a backup solution for App1 after the application is moved.
